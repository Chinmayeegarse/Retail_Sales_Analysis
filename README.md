- **Rows**: 10,000+  
- **Columns include**: Store_ID, Product_Category, Product_Name, Quantity, Sales, Profit, Discount, Date, City, Region  
- **Data preparation**: Cleaned in Microsoft Excel, then modelled and visualised in Power BI using custom DAX measures 

## Objectives  
The key objectives of this project are to:  
- Analyse revenue and profit trends over time (2022–2023)  
- Identify top-performing (and under-performing) products, categories and stores  
- Examine store- and region-wise performance and inventory dynamics  
- Support business decisions around pricing, stock management and product focus

## Key Insights  
- Top 5 stores contribute ~45% of total revenue — highlighting focus areas for growth  
- The Electronics category shows the highest profit margin (~32%) — suggesting a competitive advantage  
- Holiday months (Nov–Dec) record significant sales spikes — opportunity for seasonal promotions  
- Identified several low-performing SKUs which could be considered for markdown or discontinuation  

## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard transforms retail data into actionable business insights by uncovering revenue drivers, profit trends, and inventory gaps. It highlights how top 5 stores contribute 45% of total revenue, Electronics leads with a 32% profit margin, and seasonal peaks (Nov–Dec) can guide better stock and pricing strategies — enabling smarter, data-driven business decisions.
